JDBC Utility Methods that I can't seem to find in other commons type projects for some reason.

It's a set of utility methods for dealing with things like nullable values in ResultSets which for some reason isn't simply available any any commons-* type library that I can find out there.  I guess it's too basic stuff, but it's kind of annoying to have to write every time so I created this.

It doesn't have any compile or run dependencies.  All of the dependencies you see in the pom.xml are just for testing.
